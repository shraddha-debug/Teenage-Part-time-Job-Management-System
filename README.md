# Teenage-Part-time-Job-Management-System
This is a source code for an online job portal made for teenagers aimed to provide them with innovative part time jobs. These jobs will give exposure to them and lead in their over all development. It works in two parts. One interface is for the teenagers to search and apply for jobs and the other interface is for the employer to post jobs and review applications.
This software provides the following functions:
1) Login in/Sign in securely
2) Search for jobs
3) Upload resume or answer appropriate questions as an alternate to resume
4) Apply for jobs
5) Post job requirements
6) Review applications
7) Select candidates
This is a group project.
